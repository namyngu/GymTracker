<h1>GymTracker App</h1>

<p>For my Capstone Project I’ve decided to creat a fitness app on the android device that’s designed for users to be able to create their own customised exercises and workout routines. The app also features a step counter where each counts the number of steps users take each day and saves it in the local database. The steps taken each day are then displayed in a report screen as a bar chart for the last 7 days.
The exercises and workout routines are displayed in the app as live data and are updated automatically when users add new entries.</p>

Below is the ER diagram for the app, which provides a high-level overview of the application’s architecture:
