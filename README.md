<h1>GymTracker App</h1>

<p>For my Capstone Project I’ve created a fitness app on the android device that’s designed for users to be able to create their own customised exercises and workout routines. The app also features a step counter where each counts the number of steps users take each day and saves it in the local database. The steps taken each day are then displayed in a report screen as a bar chart for the last 7 days.
The exercises and workout routines are displayed in the app as live data and are updated automatically when users add new entries. Unfortunately, due to time constraints and how surprisingly complicated the SQL relationships between different entities for this application, which led to many changes in the database schema. We weren’t able to implement every feature set out in the project proposal. Namely, we haven’t been able to implement logging sets and reps for each training workout.</p>
